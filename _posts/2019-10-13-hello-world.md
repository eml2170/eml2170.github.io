title: First blog post!

Hi there, this is my <strong>first</strong> blog post! Not sure if this will actually turn into something, but this is <em>pretty neat</em>.

### Design

I completely copied this website from 
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com), a theme built on top of 
* [Poole](http://getpoole.com), an instance of a 
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site, a <sup>simple</sup> markdown-driven static site generator.

And you probably noticed this is running on
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which seems to host Jekyll sites particularly well because it is powered by Jekyll behind the scenes.

From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.
