I"³<p>Hi there, this is my <strong>first</strong> blog post! Not sure if this will actually turn into something, but this is <em>pretty neat</em>.</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p>I completely copied this website from</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com">Lanyon</a>, a theme built on top of</li>
  <li><a href="http://getpoole.com">Poole</a>, an instance of a</li>
  <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> site, a <sup>simple</sup> markdown-driven static site generator.</li>
</ul>

<p>And you probably noticed this is running on</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>, which seems to host Jekyll sites particularly well because it is powered by Jekyll behind the scenes.</li>
</ul>

<p>From <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown">the projectâ€™s readme</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [â€¦] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.</p>
